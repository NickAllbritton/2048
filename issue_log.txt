Issue #1 (8-15-23) Type: bug
When the entire first column is filled and cannot collapse, moving the second column up and down
does not spawn a new tile ever. No investigation done so far to find the source of the error. This
seems to also be the case when in a left move is made and the first column is all filled though
that is not thoroughly tested. I do not remember the logic of how the tile generation after a move
works, so it may need a complete rewrite.

Issue #2 (8-15-23) Type: in development
The load game menu button does nothing. This is because though the program is structured to allow
a game to be started from a previous saved game by passing the name in the board constructor, the
logic has not been written in the following places:

i) To load a game, the event loop's menu section has a spot to handle when the load game menu 
option is selected. This should draw over the menu (as a first simple solution) with a 
"Load Game" prompt and a list of saved games and it should set a flag to change the event handler
code to work with the load menu navigation instead. Once a game is selected, enter that game
by calling startGame(name) and clear the flag.
Done? Yes!

ii) In the Board class, spawnInitialTiles(int) has a section dedicated to loading a saved game's 
state. This should read from a file and simply populate the correct tiles.
Done? Yes!

iii) For a game to be loaded, there must be a saved game. In the gameplay section of the event loop,
the case for the s key should open a simple overlay menu to save the current game state.
Done? No

iv) In the Board class, there needs to be a method to save the state of the game. This should write
to a file in ../resources/ (relative to bin/) containing the saved games' states.
Done? No

Issue #3 (8-15-23) Type: in development
The credits and high scores menu options do nothing. 
i) The credits should scroll the credits by at a reasonable pace as a nice effect and exit to the 
menu when done. 
Done? No

The high scores option needs to list all the scores of the saved games and previous saved games 
with an option by each to see the final board or to delete the entry. Should incomplete games be 
included in this list? Not sure
Done? No

Issue #4 (8-15-23) Type: in development
The colors of the tiles are from an old version. I have a new color scheme and want to use that
instead. Each tile should have a color based on its number which is some form of pink. The
larger the number the brighter with rgb ratio matching that of the menu.highlighted menu option.
The background of the board should be changed, as well. Still grey, and probably still the same
rgb ratio as the background but brighter or darker....
Choose a starting color as the minimum brightness and decide how much each color should be
increased by each higher number to keep the ratio approximately the same. All tile numbers are
powers of two so take log2(num)*increase for r, g, and b as long as all three are below 255. This
should be an elegant solution unless there is something I didn't think about which there alway
is.....

Issue #5 (8-15-23) Type: bug
When a tile's number reaches 4 digits, it no longer fits in the square. This is because to choose
the text size, I am calculating based on the height of the text and not the length. It would make 
sense to calculate the ratio of the length of the number to tileLen and then find a way to adjust
the font size to meet that ideal ratio for each number of digits. This could be simple or
complicated and I won't know until I start working on it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Issue #6 (8-15-23) Type: in development
There needs to be a side bar on the left displaying functions like "exit to menu" or "save game"
and there needs to be a score. The high scores can be displayed (without interaction) on the right
and maybe toggled? Contain these in the board class as a part of drawing but NOT AS DATA. It
should be for visual purposes only. Of course, future me, feel free to disagree.... but you're
probably wrong.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Issue #7 (8-15-23) Type: in development
Draw a grid of the color scheme's turquoise color over the board with a thick outline. Cells may
need padding. The board will definitely need a border but that should not be important for any
size calculations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Issue #8 (8-15-23) Type: bug
Some calculations are properly handled as ratios of the window size, BUT window resizes are not
handled in events(). Additionally, some drawing may not be properly placed, but that will be
discovered once window resizing is handled. This should easily be fixed by replacing the wnd
dimensions stored in game, though this part of the code was not yet thought out carefully (it is
probably messy).
